# Meeting Application - Case Study Problem

## Overview

The application that maintains meetings for a user (say, yourself). 

This application helps you manage your meetings - you can filter to view meetings (past, present and future), or
search for meetings based on the meetings description. 

You can add (i.e. create) meetings. You will by default be part of a meeting you create. The users added when creating a meeting will automatically be part of the meeting (no concept of accepting a meeting!). 

However, they can excuse themselves from the meeting (drop off from a scheduled meeting).
