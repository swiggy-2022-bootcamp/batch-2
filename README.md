## Problem Statement Overview

It is known fact that in todayâ€™s work-from-home world, people prefer ordering food that can be delivered at the comfort of their home. So most of the times people end up ordering food from restaurants that have delivery services. The objective of this problem statement is to come up with a solution for people to order food online and get prompt delivery.
We need to solve the given problem by developing a web application, that should facilitate users to order food online from different restaurants using the web-app to cater their needs.

2. The user may login to the system to access the platform features.
3. The user may add a new food.
4. The user may browse through the foods on the platform.
5. The user may update his profile.
6. The user may delete his profile.
7. User profiles can be fetched all at once or by IDs.

## Additional features

1. On login, user receives a time-limited token to access the platform features without re-entering the login credentials everytime.
2. The user may fetch his profile by the JSON Web Token.
3. The user may update existing food.
4. Developers of the platform can browse and test the APIs through Swagger-UI.
